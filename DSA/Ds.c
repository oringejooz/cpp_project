/*Data Structures -Stores data in an Organised form, Easy access ,Reduce time and space complexity,easy modification
Time Complexity = Running TIme and Execution TIMe
Turing Machine- Alan Turing
    Eg: Linear Search Algorithm 



Running Time- Total no of steps taken by an algorithm to give a solution
    Assumptions :
        Every step takes 1 unit time
        All constant steps will be considered collectively as a single constant represented by '1'
Algorithms- are a sequential set of computational steps that solve a computational problem and generate an input output relationship
finite time
Properties:
Easy to understand
Can be written in any language(including Natural Languages)
Should be unambiguous
should be finite
should solve the problem
