/*Null Pointer doesn't point to any memory location
Represents an invalid memory location

Dangling Pointer- Points to a non existing memory location

Static Memory Allocation - Memory Allocated during compile time is called static memory allocation(During the creation of the program)
The memory allocated is fixed and cannot be increased or decreased during run time
Eg:

int arr[]={1,2,3,4,5,6};
Least flexibility
Wastage of memory

Dynamic Memory Allocation- Allocation of memory during run time(At the time of execution)
Built in functions-
malloc()
calloc()
realloc()
free()
